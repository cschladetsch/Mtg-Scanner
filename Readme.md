# Mtg Android Scanner
This is a simple app to scan Magic the Gathering (Mtg) cards, to get readable info and prices for them.

Note that you only need to scan the Card Title. It can sometimes take a while for an Android  phone to do this manually. You assist by tapping on the card title text.

Nightlies are on 'dev' branch. 'master' branch only contains last stable built.

The default view is of 'master' branch.

## Limitations
There is no deckbuilding or Library management. That will come later in other apps.

## Scope
This app is just about scanning a card and returning the description of the card, as well as it's price.

Other apps and systems are planned after this basic task is finished. This inclucde deckbuilding and so on.

But, first things first.

## Cost
This app uses many APIs, including Google Vision API. This is no longer free, but I think you get like 100 scans per month for free.

The other APIs also cost money, but I've changed them to free ones. Also, I download the entire Scryraft database every other day. So everything should be up to date and not require anything other than the GoogleVision API.
